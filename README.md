## About Me

<samp>
  I am a technology enthusiast. I started early as a developer. My first contact with programming was at 14 years old and I hold a high school degree in computer technician at 16 years old.

  I ended up liking the area a lot, even going to college in System Analysis and Development (similar to Computer Science) and working as a Front-End Developer in a consulting company at 18 years old.

  I always try to do my best even dedicating myself as much as I can. Being involved in the world of technology for me means being close to solving everyday problems, and making people’s lives easily. Furthermore, learning, teaching, and helping are always a pleasure.

  I am a Brazilian native speaker and I am studying English.
